# web-scrapers-of-news-websites
This repository contains examples of web scrapers that are designed to collect news articles from several tunisian news websites

You will find for each website a scraper written in python that generates one or more csv files (depending on the number of languages provided by the website).
Each csv file contains links, titles, contents and categories of the extracted articles.
## Usage
Each scraper is saved in a different branch as a python file (.py) and you will also find a python notebook (.ipynb)
you can execute the python code from your command prompt
```bash
python.exe script.py
```
or you can open the notebook on jupiter or on https://colab.research.google.com/
